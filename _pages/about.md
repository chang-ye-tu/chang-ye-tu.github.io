I received my PhD in [Actuarial Science](https://rmi.nccu.edu.tw/) from [National Chengchi University](https://www.nccu.edu.tw/app/home.php). Previously I received my MSc in [Applied Mechanics](https://www.iam.ntu.edu.tw/en/) and BSc in [Civil Engineering](https://www.ce.ntu.edu.tw/en/home/), both from [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/index.html).

Being trained in computational solid mechanics, electromagnetics, and quantitative finance has equipped me with better understanding of the essence of interdisciplinary computing. Computing has been my greatest passion, and the aim of my [research](research) is to develop practical algorithmic solutions for real-world industrial problems. Part of my work has been [published](publications) and / or [open sourced](software). The [teaching](teaching) experience in scientific computing and quantitative finance coupled with decade long [practices](https://github.com/chang-ye-tu/ananda) in computer-assisted learning / memorizing have shaped my thinking of effective learning and knowledge transfer.
